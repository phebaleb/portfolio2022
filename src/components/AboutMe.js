                <p>Hey, I'm Phoebe! I'm a 20 year old Front-End Web Designer. I was born and raised in the Wellington region, and have always had a keen eye for the abundance of art and design that decorates the beautiful Capital.</p>

                <h2>WHAT I DO</h2>
                <p>I've had an interest in Design since my early high school days and excelled in the subject throughout school, before finally moving on to study these skills on a tertiary level. I spent a year studying Web and Graphic Design in 2021, earning my level 5 Diploma. I then moved on to advance my visual and technical skills in completing a Web and UX Design course over the course of 2022. With a level 6 Diploma now under my belt, I'm ready to bring my skills and knowledge to the industry!</p>
